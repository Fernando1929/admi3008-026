<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
<p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <i>sous vide</i>. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>
<p>Next month, we will be serving <strong><i>Sous Vide</i> Salmon with Dill Hollandaise.</strong>  To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before <time datetime="2020-11-30">November 30</time>.</p>

<p>Warning: <i>Sous vide</i> cooked salmon is not pasteurized. Avoid it if you are pregnant or have immunity issues.</p>
